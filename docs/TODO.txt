It's mostly a bunch of personal notes, probably incomplete. Feel free to query if you have any questions.

- window class: alot of work needs to happen here to clean this up.

- build system: alot of work to cleanup and simplify this system

- CI/CD system: cleanup and instead of building python, make them use the runner installed python versions.

- doc: work on the CONTRIBUTING.md file
- doc/wiki: work on the wiki https://github.com/RaylockLLC/DearPyGui/wiki

- widgets: combo flags for height and no_preview and no_arrow need to be implemeted as flag system to prevent oversetting flag crash, fyi align_left does nothing

- 3d widget: add a 3d widget similar to the one provided in javafx or wpf

- custom widgets: add a fully supported custom widget API to allow users to make their own widgets more easily

- plot: add heatmap charts

- text edit widget: basically open up the widget used in _show_source_ for user control
- text edit widget: add multifile support

- builds: automate dev version number
- builds: write tests to ensure everything was actually packaged in the wheel

- misc: deal with deprecation of codecvt
- misc: add support for raspberry pi

- mvPythonTranslator: make commands more consistent, more like ToPyPairII

- layouts: because there is not a way to know boarder sizes on things like the main window and also the childs it maks sizing hard same for menu. its hard to set a child to fill the main window width
- layout: doing add_spacing in count when everything is in pixels is weird
- layout: group has no height attribute which would be useful for when the croup is set to horizontal

- Marvel: Split into mvDrawingInterface, mvPlotInterface, mvTableInterface, mvThemeInterface, mvInputInterface, mvWidgetInterface, mvAppItemInterface, mvAppInterface
